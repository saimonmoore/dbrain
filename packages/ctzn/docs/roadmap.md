The CTZN protocol is still in active development. This document tracks what changes are still in development or planned for the future.

|Feature|Description|Status|
|-|-|-|
|**Cross-server communication**|Interactions within communities and between social relationships across multiple servers.|âœ…&nbsp;Mostly&nbsp;complete.|
|**Reduced RPC API**|Reduce the WebSocket RPC API to a minimal set of database interactions and moving all business logic into the data layer. This improves cross-server communication and lays the groundwork for smart contracts / community constitutions.|Next&nbsp;priority.|
|**User key rotation**|Changing the public-key of a user/community hypercore.|Near&nbsp;future.|
|**User re-homing**|Moving a user/community from one server to another.|Near&nbsp;future.|
|**Private spaces**|Private communities and/or content. (Currently all content is public.)|Future.|
|**Smart contracts / Community constitutions**|A programmable and highly-auditable layer for introducing custom data schemas, business logic, and user interfaces in communities.|Future.|
|**Serverless applications**|Participate in the CTZN network using desktop/mobile applications without a server.|Future.|
|**User key ownership**|Store user private keys on their devices rather than in the servers, sync keys between devices, and coordinate writes offline.|Future.|
